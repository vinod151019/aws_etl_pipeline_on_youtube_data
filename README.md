# aws_etl_pipeline_on_youtube_data

Over 2.6 billion individuals worldwide use YouTube monthly, making it one of the top-most visited websites. Now, imagine your company will launch a new data-driven campaign, and you are in charge of the campaign advertisements. Which platform do you think will be ideal for the advertisement? None other than YouTube! This means the company will have to analyze large volumes of YouTube data using various tools and metrics to effectively understand how to advertise its new campaign on the platform. The company might want to find answers to questions such as ‘how to categorize videos based on the number of comments and statistics’, ‘what factors affect how popular a YouTube video will be’, etc.

This project aims to securely manage data, streamline, and analyze the structured and semi-structured YouTube video data based on the video categories and trending metrics.
